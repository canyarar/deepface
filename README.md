# DeepFace Age, Emotion, and Gender Detection with Speech Output

This project is a deep learning-based facial analysis tool developed using Python. The project utilizes the DeepFace library to detect age, emotion, and gender information from faces, and then uses Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to audibly announce this information.

## Installation

1. Clone this project: `git clone https://github.com/canyarar/deepface.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd deepface`
3. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Obtain your Google Text-to-Speech API key and place it in the appropriate section of the project.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script: `python main.py`
2. The program will perform facial detection and retrieve age, emotion, and gender information.
3. You will hear this information audibly announced.

## Note

- This project relies on the DeepFace and gTTS libraries. Make sure these dependencies are correctly installed.
- An internet connection is required to use the Google Text-to-Speech API.
